# Equify (https://equify-deployment-ekpzaeq7sa-uc.a.run.app)

Equify is an equity tool that helps investors model the impacts of new financings. Here are the steps to modeling your new financing:
1. Update your current cap table with the number of shares and options outstanding today.
2. Add any existing SAFEs or convertible notes that will be converted after your financing. You can see the conversion results of these financial instruments below.
3. Input your next financing round details - this includes investors, round size, and pre-money valuation. This information will help us determine your implied post-money valuation.
4. Check out your pro forma cap table!
